                    <h1>Camping </h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">Sometimes camping and its associated activities present you with challenges (and some that not even Professor Google can reliably solve). Often these are challenges that you don’t deal with on a daily basis: where and how to set up your tent; or how to deal with scenarios where you aren’t armed with all your mod-cons or items of familiarity.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p class="paragraph">In addition, camping introduces you to new experiences – perhaps an activity you’d always wanted to try but never found time for. Whatever the case, new challenges and experiences keep your brain healthy, as they force you to think for yourself.</p>

                    <h1>Canoeing</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">Canoeing can be a great workout, but compared to sports like running and skiing, impact on the joints is low. If you have sore knees or hips and are slowing down your participation in high-impact activities, canoeing allows you to maintain fitness and enjoy being outside while still being easy on the joints. Canoeing can also be combined with other low-impact exercises on the same trip, like trail walking, yoga and swimming at the campsite.</p>
                <br>
                    <p class="paragraph">Exercise can reduce symptoms of stress and depression for up to 12 hours. When you are out in the open Reduce Stress in kayaking and canoeingsurrounded by nature, the effects will be significantly enhanced. The amount of time might not be extended, yet the calming effect you feel will be so much better.</p>

                    <h1>Climbing</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">Rock climbing can be described as any situation where you’re ‘climbing’ up a rock. It could be at a climbing gym, a mountain side or a natural rock climbing location, or a ‘bouldering’ spot which is rock climbing, only it’s done sideways as opposed to climbing up. (It’s more focused on low to the ground movements). Anyway, let’s move on.</p>
                <br>
                    <p class="paragraph">You’re required to use your strength to cling to the wall and often times you are holding most of your muscles in a static hold, constantly tensed. You should aim to be as relaxed as possible to get better at climbing, but sometimes you can’t and it’s very hard work. This is a good thing</p>

                    <h1>Fishing</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">By going fishing your main muscle groups, heart and lungs are all getting a good work out. Choosing a fishing spot that's a 10 to 15 minute walk from your car is an obvious boost to aerobic exercise. But setting up, casting off and then winding in hundreds of small fish calls for a bit of strength. Let alone some of the huge carp or pike you can find in our waters. It engages the shoulders, back, arms, core and legs in an active workout.</p>
                <br>
                    <p class="paragraph">Fishing is all about personal goals, and attaining those goals is a sure fire way to improve self-esteem. It’s also a lifelong skill that you can enjoy at any age. Every angler remembers their first catch. Just look at the way their eyes light up when they talk about it. Fishing is also the perfect skill to pass on. With grandfathers taking grandchildren out to a local canal and showing them how to hook a maggot. Spending time with your family also promotes feelings of security and wellbeing, making fishing a worthwhile activity to learn.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">A healthy body is a happy body, and one of the best ways to stay healthy is to get plenty of exercise. Hiking is an economical way to increase your activity level, while offering a plethora of health benefits. Start slowly, especially if you are a bit out of shape. Invest in a sturdy pair of hiking boots and do your research first. Many hiking trails are rated by intensity, so get a hiking guide and start out at the level that is right for you. Get your doctor's advice before hiking if you are pregnant or have any health problems, such as heart disease or diabetes.</p>
                <br>
                    <p class="paragraph">Hiking is an excellent way to get outdoors and get some exercise. Hiking offers a wealth of overall health benefits and may help prolong your life. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, including hiking at your own level, is safe for most people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

                    <h1>Hunting</h1>
                    <p class="paragraph">The benefits of hunting sports are that they provide exercise, social and emotional health benefits and a nutritious, low-fat protein. Good luck to all the hunters and if you haven’t tried hunting, fishing or trapping sports, go out and enjoy what nature has to offer, the benefits are numerous!The objective of hunting is to bring home game meat. Game meat generally is a lean protein. Venison (meat from deer) and elk meat both are low in fat. Game birds, such as partridge and pheasants and game such as rabbit all are lean meats, meaning they have less fat too.</p>
                <br>
                    <p class="paragraph">Besides the physical benefits of walking the woods, hunting provides social-emotional health benefits. Many hunters feel that they receive a therapeutic/relaxed feeling when out hunting or enjoy the quality time that it provides to be with family and friends..Adding to the intrigue, there are many new reality hunting, fishing and survival television shows depicting the same message.</p>
