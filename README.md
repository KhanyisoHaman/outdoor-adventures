Brief:

 

Camping describes a range of activities and approaches to outdoor accommodation. ... Camping may be combined with hiking, as in backpacking, and is often enjoyed in conjunction with other outdoor activities such as canoeing, climbing, fishing, and hunting. When the chaos of city life gets too much, escape into the wild â€“ and stay the night. There are so many beautiful hiking trails in the Western Cape's nature reserves that it's hard to know where to start! Most CapeNature reserves offer walk
